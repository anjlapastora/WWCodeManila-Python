## About this study group

!> If you're not yet familiar with study groups, read this [document](wwcodemanila/study_groups.md)
first to know what they are.

This study group is held once a month and is led by our volunteer leaders.

Everyone is welcome to join, learn, and share their knowledge in the community
as long as they abide by our [code of conduct](https://github.com/WomenWhoCode/guidelines-resources/blob/master/code_of_conduct.md).

### Setup

During the study groups, we usually spend the time:

- getting to know first-timers,
- discussing questions/issues raised during the last meetup,
- presenting lightning talks (anyone who wants to share/chika something!),
- doing self-paced and/or mini study sessions
- sharing TILS (Today I Learned), and
- communicating announcements.
