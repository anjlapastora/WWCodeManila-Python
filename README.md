# Welcome to the world of Python!

!> Go to our official [GitHub Page](https://wwcodemanila.github.io/WWCodeManila-Python/#/) if you are viewing from the source code repository.

For beginners, we will learn the basic concepts of
programming using Python. This can be your jump off towards web development,
scripting, data processing and more!

For immediate/advanced Pythonistas, let's spread our knowledge of Python and learn more!

If you have questions, please feel free to ask and participate on our [Gitter group](https://gitter.im/WWCodeManila/Python).
